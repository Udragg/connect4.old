# connect4

Note: This project has been rewriten and can be found at https://github.com/Udragg/connect4.

A Rust project to make the connect 4 game on a Raspberry Pi.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a school project and still in it's very early stages.
You may use any code yourself in personal projects or to learn from, however, I do not recommend using it. It is far from optimal Rust code.
